This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to generate a random, secure password for the user.

# Psuedo Code and Project Requirements:

The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria: 8 and 120 characters

-The user will recieve a confirm for:
Password containing special characters, numbers, and uppercase

-Either 4 variables individual ones, or 3 with toLowerCase to Uppercase conversion
This will need to randomly generate a selection or randomly select array data, so math.random and math.floor will need to be used.

-The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.
If, else if statement

-Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. Displaying the generated password in an alert is acceptable, but attempt to write the password to the page instead.
